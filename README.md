### Description

__Statistics 131A__ is designed primarily as an introductory course for statistical thinking: critical thinking, interpretation, and statistical literacy. Topics include descriptive statistics, association, correlation, regression, elements of probability, chance variability, random variables, expectation, standard error, sampling, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, experiments and observational studies.

You do need to be comfortable with math at the level of intermediate algebra (e.g., the equation of a straight line, plotting points, taking powers and roots, percentages, inequalities).

You should expect to spend about 7 hours of outside work hours per week, 2 hours of instructional experiences requiring special laboratory equipment and facilities per week, and 3 hours of instructor presentation of course materials per week.


### Methods of Instruction

We will be using a combination of materials such as slides, tutorials, 
reading assignments, and chalk-and-talk.

I firmly believe that one cannot do statistical computations without the help of good statistical software. In this course, you will be asked to do various assignments and practical work using the [statistical software R](https://www.r-project.org/) with the help of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
