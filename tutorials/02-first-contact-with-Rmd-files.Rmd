## Introduction to Rmd files

In this course, you will be using one main type of source file known as 
_R markdown_ file, simply referred to as `Rmd` files. 

__Rmd__ files are a special type of file technically known as _dynamic documents_. 
This type of documents allows you to combine narrative (text) with R code, which means that you write everything (text and code) in one single file.

- In the menu bar of RStudio, click on __File__
- Then __New File__, and choose __R Markdown__
- Select the default option "Document" (HTML output), and click __Ok__.
- Locate __Knit__ the button (the one with a knitting icon) and click on it
so you can see how `Rmd` files are rendered and displayed as HTML documents.

The narrative text is written with a special syntax called
[markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). The R code is written using 
R syntax, inside _code chunks_.

It is extremeley important that you quickly become familiar with `Rmd` files. 
You'll be using `Rmd` files to write your lab and homework assignments, and 
convert them to HTML files (you could also convert them to Word, or PDF files, among other formats).



### Yet Another Syntax to Learn

R markdown (`Rmd`) files use [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
as the main syntax to write content and text.

Markdown is a very lightweight type of [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), and it is relatively easy to learn. If you are new to Markdown, please take a look at the following tutorials:

## Get to know the `Rmd` files

An `Rmd` file has a very specific structure. The first part at the very top is the YAML header. This header contains configuration options and global settings, things like: 

- title
- author
- date
- output: `html_document`

For pretty much all the assignments in this course, you can use the default options (no need to add or remove yaml settings)

The narrative text has to be written in Markdown syntax. Optionally, you can include math symbols and expressions using LaTeX notation.

The R commands must be specified inside so-called _code chunks_ or chunks. 

RStudio has a basic tutorial about R Markdown files:
[Rstudio markdown tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). Take a look at the following sections:

- Introduction
- How It Works
- Code Chunks
- Inline Code
